I have been working on project 0 for about a week now, on and off. It has
been going smoothly so far. I have as of now completed the following

- Created User entity, services, and Data Access Object
	So far, users can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted
- Have set up the main logic for either SIGN UP and LOGIN
	The user can set their admin status as well
- I am now setting up the Junit test features
